## Astronomy Assessment for AACR 
#### (AAAACR? ...probably not...hmmm...)
### Objective:
To develop a set of constructed response items probing student thinking on key concepts in astronomy

### Motivation:
 * A number of concept inventories exist covering topics in astronomy
     * Light and Spectroscopy Concept Inventory  (LSCI) (Bardar et al 2007)
     * Astronomy and Space Science Concept Inventory (Sadler et al 2010)
     * Test of Astronomy Standards (Slater et al 2011)
 * A set of constructed resoponse items can supplement these instruments by
     * Providing deeper examining of student thinking
     * Test problematic items

## LSCI Multiple Choice Version
 
<center> ![Color](assets/img/q2.png) </center>
 
Consider the dark line absorption spectra shown below for Star X and Star Z. What can you determine about the colors of the two stars? *Assume that the left end of each spectrum corresponds to shorter wavelengths (blue light) and that the right end of each spectrum corresponds with longer wavelengths (red light).* <br>
 a. Star X would appear blue and Star Z would appear red. <br> 
 b. Star X would appear red and Star Z would appear blue. <br>
 c. Both stars would appear the same color. <br>
 d. The colors of the stars cannot be determined from this information.

## Constructed Response Version
 
<center> ![Color](assets/img/q2.png) </center>

Consider the dark line absorption spectra shown below for Star X and Star Z. What can you determine about the colors of the two stars? Assume that the left end of each spectrum corresponds to shorter wavelengths (blue light) and that the right end of each spectrum corresponds with longer wavelengths (red light).

## The Test Data Set

__Introductory Astronomy__
 * 2 sections
 * N ~ 50, 150

__Administration__
 * Part of weekly homework
 * Pre-instruction ~ 40 responses
 * Post-instruction ~ 110 responses

--- &twocol

## The Exploratory Rubric Development

<center> <img src="assets/img/rubricDevel.png" width="700px" /> </center>


*** =left

__Rubric__
 - Analytic rubric
 - Constructed post-administration based solely or response content
 
*** =right

__Bins__
 - Fine grained concepts
 - Not mutually exclusive 
 - For convenience bins are grouped in categories

---

## The Expolaratory Rubric

 * 17 rubric bins
 * 3 categories of bins
     * Color comparison
     * Reasoning
     * Other information
 * All LSCI options reproduced by color comparison bins

## Item Summary and Conclusions

### Questions
 * Are students confused by item, forced to choose in face of lack of adequate information?
 * Why is "X is Blue, Z is Red" three times as popular as "X is Red, Z is Blue"?
 * Are the reasons in the test set representative of the entire population?
 
### (Tentative) Conclusions
 * Students struggle with the nature of absorption lines
 * Confusion resistant to instruction

--- &twocol

## Moving Forward

### Revise questions
<center> ![Color](assets/img/q2.png) </center>

Consider the dark line absorption spectra shown below for Star X and Star Z. What, *__if anything__*, can you determine about the colors of the two stars *__from these spectra__*? *__Explain your reasoning.__* Assume that the left end of each spectrum corresponds to shorter wavelengths (blue light) and that the right end of each spectrum corresponds with longer wavelengths (red light).

 
### Automation
